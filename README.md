# Machine Learning Classifier Comparison Project

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition, helping companies identify at-risk employees. By analyzing factors like job satisfaction, leadership opportunities, and salary, the model assists HR teams in making data-driven decisions to reduce turnover and improve employee retention. The project uses algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees for accurate predictions based on historical employee data.
